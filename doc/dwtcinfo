Subject: new termcap capabilities

Steve:
        The following is what I have as the termcap entries desired.  Please
send me back a copy of this file, appropriately modified, to confirm these
capabilities.

Name    type    pad?    description
----    ----    ----    -----------
dn      str             down (move cursor down one line; not \n)
cc      str     P       display control character (in cm form)
(dd)                    (display rubout string)
                        I think we agreed to control-? for this.
bi      str     P**     b initialization string
bf      str     P**     b final string
bw      bool    P       terminal wraps for b editor
sf      str     P**     scroll forwards (See note below)
sr      str     P**     scroll reverse  (See note below)
sb      bool            Standout mode doesn't consume a character space
                        (for b, see note below).

Notes:
P**:    There might be delay problems in specifying these sequences.  Two
        possible solutions might be:
                1) Specify these as a string of capabilities
                   as in "ko" and add new capabilities (such as terminal reset).
                2) Allow for delay specifications within a
                   string. (i.e. bi=1*\Ez\P1*\E1...).
        Pick one or suggest an alternative.

sf,sr   default these to cm to last line, then line feed, and home, insert line
        if not specified.  This should get around the delay problems mentioned
        above.

                                                doug.
